dotfiles
========

self explanatory. But seriously this is to keep a copy of my CLI development environment configuration.

Folders
--------
* gitignore - contains my usual git ignore stuff
* cocoapods - Contains a podfile for my usual Cocoapods libraries

Usage
--------
* Choose file you want (or just clone this whole repo)
* Go to RAW mode and grab the URL
* curl -o filename "http://url"
* wget "http://url"
* add . in front of the file
* If you got changes fork and do pull request
